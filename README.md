## Design Document

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ChgooUAmopHw-O4oeJ72FXvu-dZCxZNdnHbaSiHt9Go/edit?usp=sharing) is a design document for the TechTrends app. It shows how the app was conceptualized and the technologies involved in development.

**Note**
This is a living document and the contents will change as the scope of the project changes.

## Download

You can download a containerized version of the app from DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/aidenjaney).
